<h2>Hey Boss</h2>

<h2>Subject: Meal Quality   
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to bring up a concern regarding the meals being provided to the children. While I understand that food service is not within my role, I couldn’t help but notice that the meals seem to lack proper nutrition and quality.  

I know that ensuring proper nourishment is a priority, and I would appreciate some clarity on what is being served. If there’s an issue with meal preparation or sourcing, I would love to understand how it’s being addressed.  

I’d be grateful for any insight you can provide. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.  

Best,
Sharon</h2>
